this is basically two different themes mashed together .. 
slimline and terminal envy for gtk 

Im not shur how to make a install file just yet.. 
when i figure out how to ill update it but till then

to install just extract into ~/.themes/

open menu / settings / xfce4 settings manager / appearance select the gtk-trinity theme 
and then go to the window manager and select xfce4-trinity. 

the buttons should be in be hide - maximize - title - close, the icons have a bit of a 
odd spacing. if anything doesn't work let me know and ill try to fix it .. 


thanks to the person who made slimline  <-- could n't find a link it this.. it came with xfce4 for maybe its default ? 
and Brian Assaf for making terminal envy.
