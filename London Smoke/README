Londons Smoke by Padster/theRealPadster

There are different variations included, with normal and small sized scrollbars, with and without steppers, and with the window buttons on the left and right.

For the GTK:
-s means with steppers
-t means thin
so -ts means thin with steppers
and the one called just plain London Smoke is normal, without steppers

For the Metacity:
-right and -left are for the button sides

You should now be able to install more than one at a time, but it will not have a full preview in the Appearance Preferences, you will have to hit "customize".

Metacity themes included, but no Emerald themes due to it being glitchy and not working right.

The icon theme recommended for use alongside is mistEEK, which can be found at:
